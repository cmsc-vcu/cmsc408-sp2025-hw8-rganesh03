Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

# CMSC408 - Fall 2024 - Homework 7

This is the Homework 8 Repository. The purpose of this repository is to learn more about and practice queries in a larger database using SQL.

In order to use this repository, you must have python, poetry, quarto, and sql installed. Once installed, you can use `poetry shell` and `poetry install` to add all dependencies. Edit the SQL database if you wish and change the queries to get different results. Use `quarto render` to render the `report.qmd` file into an updated `report.html` file, both found in the `reports` folder. 

This repository also contains a `source-data` folder contiang a `loader.qmd` that loads in the data from the World Bank data catalogue into your datbase and is populated in spreadsheets in a downloadable ZIP file.
